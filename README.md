# HiveMindHealth - Find consensus on matters of nutrition

An early-stage work in progress, HiveMindHealth will provide a free 
 online portal to numerous online nutrition related resources.  The 
 goal is to help users find consensus on topics of nutrition given 
 a food product, ingredient, or menu item.

Visit <a href="http://hivemindhealth.com">HiveMindHealth</a> to take
 a peek at the current state of the app.

### Current Resources

 * FatSecret -- provides a free RESTful API to a comprehensive database
    of nutritional information.
 * reddit.com/r/nutrition, r/foodscience, r/healthyfood -- see what other 
    HiveMinds have to say!

### Future Resources

 * wikipedia.com -- a 'HiveMind' resource
 * LabelAPI (provided by foodessentials.com) -- another free API tapping
    into nurition information.
 * NutryOS -- an interesting looking in-Beta nutrition resource.
 * TBD!
